		Dear Sir or Madam,
		<br>
		<br>
		I am currently a Master student, specialized in Digital Marketing, at the IESEG School of Management in Paris. At this point in my academic career I am looking for a 24-week marketing internship abroad beginning in January 2022. It is in this perspective that I am addressing you today. I am very interested in working in the marketing sector in the future, for the diverse, international and dynamic side that this type of business represents. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I have been able to carry out various projects over the past few years, both academic and personal, thanks to my dynamic and rigorous nature. For example, I organized an Interrail trip during the summer of 2019, which was a real success. I also have strong interpersonal skills. Being an academic exchange student in London for a year during my second year, this experience allowed me to acquire a strong open mind and to create strong friendships with people from very different backgrounds. Finally, I was able to demonstrate a great capacity to adapt, which also served me well during my sales internship at Atelier Emma&ChloeÃÅ. Thanks to this, I was in charge of training a new saleswoman after only one month of internship at the Atelier. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I will put my knowledge and enthusiasm at your disposal to carry out the desired tasks as best as possible.
		<br>
		<br>	
		 
		Looking forward to your response, Madam, Sir, please accept my best regards.
         <br>
         <br>
		Astrid LEROUX
